Your first challenge...

Given a chemical formula, e.g. NaCl (table salt) or C6H12O6 (glucose), output a
table of each element followed its quantity. For the above examples, the output
would be...

Cl: 1
Na: 1

...and...

C: 6
H: 12
O: 6

...respectively. Beware of elements with two letter names (e.g. Na or Cl). Right
now, your input data will not include formulae with parenthesis (glucose, for
example, can be rewritten as 6(CH2O)). This complication will come in a later
challenge.

Your program should read molecules from molecules_data.txt and write the tables
to molecules_solution.txt. There will be one molecular formula per line in
the data file. Make sure to output the tables in the format
[element]: [quantity], with the rows sorted alphabetically by element. To
avoid confusion in the output file, write a blank line after each table.
